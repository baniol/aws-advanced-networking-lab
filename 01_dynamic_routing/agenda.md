building a low-cost BGP lab is a smart move for preparing for the AWS Advanced Networking Specialty. Since you're already very experienced with AWS and infrastructure, I‚Äôll give you a few tailored options ‚Äî both local (free/low-cost) and AWS-based (still budget-conscious) ‚Äî so you can choose based on convenience and depth.

‚úÖ Option 1: Local Lab with FRRouting in Docker
Best for: Quick iterations, reproducible, low-to-zero cost

Why it works:
Docker containers with FRRouting (FRR) can act as BGP routers.

You can simulate BGP peering, route advertisement, filtering, and even failures.

Can be run entirely offline.

Setup Plan:
Use docker-compose to spin up 3-5 containers with FRR.

Connect them with a custom Docker bridge or macvlan network for L2 behavior.

Use tools like vtysh inside each container to configure BGP sessions.

Optionally, simulate a cloud-like setup by advertising ‚ÄúVPC-like‚Äù CIDRs.

üí° Bonus: You can simulate route reflector behavior and test path selection via AS path and prefix filtering.

‚úÖ Option 2: GNS3 or EVE-NG with Virtual Routers
Best for: Real routing software, if you want to use Cisco/Juniper images

Use GNS3 or EVE-NG (both are free) on a local VM or machine.

Deploy virtual routers (e.g., FRR, VyOS, or even Cisco IOSv/JunOS if licensed).

More realistic, but heavier on resources.

‚úÖ Option 3: Lightweight AWS Setup (~free-tier with bursts)
Best for: Practicing AWS-native BGP (Direct Connect/VGW/Transit Gateway peering)

You‚Äôll need:

2 VPCs in different regions or accounts.

A Transit Gateway with route tables and BGP peering via EC2 routers (FRR/VyOS).

Or use BGP over VPN with Virtual Private Gateways to emulate Direct Connect.

Budget Tips:
Use t3.micro or t4g.micro instances (free-tier eligible).

Use Terraform or scripts to tear down quickly after a session.

Schedule labs for off-hours and shut down instances when not in use.

üîÅ Hybrid Idea
Run your FRR-based lab locally, and optionally connect a container/VM to a VPN that reaches your AWS VPC ‚Äî now you're peering between local router ‚Üî AWS router via BGP.

üîß Tools That Help:
Containerlab: Clean way to define and run network topologies with Docker and FRR/VyOS.

FRR on Docker Hub: Official container images.

Wireshark/tcpdump: For packet captures during BGP session negotiation.

Would you like...
I can give you:

A ready-made Docker Compose FRR BGP lab

Or a Terraform script to spin up the AWS Transit Gateway + BGP EC2 routers

Or even a Containerlab YAML topology if you go that route
